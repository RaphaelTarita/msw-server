# How to Contribute to this GitHub Repository

## 1. Issues
Everyone that is using this project in any way is encouraged to open up issues when they encounter any inconsistency that should be reviewed and possibly fixed by the contributors of this repository. Issues can be about:
- Reporting a bug (1.1 What is a bug?)
- Requesting a feature (1.2 What is a feature?)
- Anything else you want the contributors to take a look at

Issues are an effective way for the community to contact the developers and shape the project in the way it wants without actually getting involved in developing the application. Especially bug reports are as well helpful for the developers who might not have known about the bug without the issue. Issues in this repository are used to constantly improve and extend the project, as well as organizing all of what is still "to do" into concise tasks. Therefore, note that issues may as well be opened, commented, worked on and closed solely by contributors without the interaction of the community.

To contribute to this project using GitHub Issues, select [Issues](https://github.com/RaphaelTarita/msw-server/issues) in the navigation bar, then click "New issue". You will be prompted to select one of the provided issue templates (currently available: Bug Report, Feature Request). Please choose the fitting category (see below) and follow the instructions in the template precisely. If your issue does not fit into the given categories, click "Open a blank issue", compose a descriptive text and explain why it is neither a bug report nor a feature request.

### 1.1 What is a bug?
A bug is generally considered as a flaw in the application code that causes the application to not work as it is intended. In this repository, a bug is defined as any crash, error or behavior that deviates from the specification, meaning that the application does not behave like it should, according to the documentation or to in-app descriptions. As a rule of thumb, crashes or error messages are almost always bugs and should therefore be reported with a GitHub Issue, using the Bug Report template. If the problem does _not_ involve any crashes or error messages, ask yourself the question whether the application does not behave like it _should_ or not like _you want_ it to behave. In the second case, it most likely fits the "Feature Request" category better. In the Bug Report template, three categories of bugs are described:

1. Application crashes
2. Error messages and similar
3. Unexpected behavior

For more information about bug reports, refer to the [Bug Report Issue template](https://github.com/RaphaelTarita/msw-server/issues/new?assignees=RaphaelTarita&labels=bug&template=bug-report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D+%3CDescriptive+Title%3E).

### 1.2 What is a feature?
A feature is, in the scope of this repository, anything that _you_ would like to be added to the application. This can mean completely new functionalities as well as improvements of existing elements. As a discrimination from bugs, feature requests are not referring to deviations from the specified behavior. In other words, the app is behaving "correctly", but you would like to add a certain aspect. If you are writing an issue because you had an idea on how to improve the application, it is most likely a feature request. In the Feature Request template, three categories of features are described:

1. Behaviors that conform to the specification but are greatly uncomfortable to work with as a user
2. The lack of a very important functionality
3. A new idea for a helpful improvement or addition

For more information about feature requests, refer to the [Feature Request Issue template](https://github.com/RaphaelTarita/msw-server/issues/new?assignees=RaphaelTarita&labels=feature&template=feature-request.md&title=%5BFEAT%5D+%3CDescriptive+Title%3E)

## 2. Forking and Pull Requests

You are always free to fork this repository and extend or edit it in any way you want. If you feel like your additions and improvements should be part of the canonical application, feel free to open up a pull request. Note, however, that the contributors do not consider themselves obliged to handle every single pull request or even to accept all of them.

## 3. Becoming a contributor

Currently, the project is openly accessible but has only one contributor with full editing access to the repository.

I'd be happy to welcome people from the community in the development team!
